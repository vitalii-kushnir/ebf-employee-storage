## Requirement Specification

### Definition

We're building an employee storage service for companies. 

A company admin needs to be able to:
- create employee records for company,
- view them in a list and detail view for company, 
- update the employee records and delete them for company,
- find the average salary for the company

Your task is to build the backend for this service. 

It should be a rest API that exposes the required endpoints.

The company data can either be autogenerated or configurable or dynamically created. (Up to you)
